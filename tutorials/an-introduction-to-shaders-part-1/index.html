  Giant ascii art embedded in every page of your site is how you
  show other people that YOU CARE. Mainly I care about developers,
  which is what I presume you are if you're all about viewing
  the source. Clearly you're my kind of person.

  This is v3, it's run through Jekyll, it's been fun to build,
  there's always more to do, and you may notice that aside from
  Google Analytics there is no JavaScript. None.

  That's one way of many you keep your pages fast. I care about
  keeping this site fast because your time is precious and I need
  to get out of your way.

      <h2>An Introduction to Shaders - Part 1</h2>
      <p></p>
    </div>

  </div>

  

  <div class="container"><div class="left column">
<p>## Introduction</p>

<p>I’ve previously given you <a href="../getting-started-
with-three-js/">an introduction to Three.js</a>. If you’ve not read that you might want to as it’s the
foundation on which I will be building during this article.</p>

<p>What I want to do is discuss shaders. WebGL is brilliant, and as I’ve said
before <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">Three.js</a> (and other libraries)
do a fantastic job of abstracting away the difficulties for you. But there
will be times you want to achieve a specific effect, or you will want to dig a
little deeper into how that amazing stuff appeared on your screen, and shaders
will almost certainly be a part of that equation. Also if you’re like me you
may well want to go from the basic stuff in the last tutorial to something a
little more tricky. I’ll work on the basis that you’re using Three.js, since
it does a lot of the donkey work for us in terms of getting the shader going.</p>

<p>I’ll say up front as well that quite a lot of this will be me explaining the
context for shaders, and that there will be a second part of this guide where
we will get into slightly more advanced territory. The reason for this is that
shaders are unusual at first sight and take a bit of explaining.</p>

<h2 id="our-two-shaders">Our Two Shaders</h2>

<p>WebGL does not offer the use of the Fixed Pipeline, which is a shorthand way
of saying that it doesn’t give you any means of rendering your stuff out of
the box. What it <em>does</em> offer, however, is the Programmable Pipeline, which is
more powerful but also more difficult to understand and use. In short the
Programmable Pipeline means as the programmer you take responsibility for
getting the vertices and so forth rendered to the screen. Shaders are a part
of this pipeline, and there are two types of them:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Vertex shaders</li>
  <li>Fragment shaders</li>
</ol>

<p>Both of which, I’m sure you’ll agree, mean absolutely nothing by themselves.
What you should know about them is that they both run entirely on your
graphics card’s GPU. This means that we want to offload all that we can to
them, leaving our CPU to do other work. A modern GPU is heavily optimised for
the functions that shaders require so it’s great to be able to use it.</p>

<h2 id="vertex-shaders">Vertex Shaders</h2>

<p>Take a standard primitive shape, like a sphere. It’s made up of vertices,
right? A vertex shader is given every single one of these vertices in turn and
can mess around with them. It’s up to the vertex shader what it actually does
with each one, but it has one responsibility: it must at some point set
something called <code>gl_Position</code>, a 4D float vector, which is the final
position of the vertex on screen. In and of itself that’s quite an interesting
process, because we’re actually talking about getting a 3D position (a vertex
with x,y,z) onto, or projected, to a 2D screen. Thankfully for us if we’re
using something like Three.js we will have a shorthand way of setting the
<code>gl_Position</code> without things getting too heavy.</p>

<h2 id="fragment-shaders">Fragment Shaders</h2>

<p>So we have our object with its vertices, and we’ve projected them to the 2D
screen, but what about the colours we use? What about texturing and lighting?
That’s exactly what the fragment shader is there for.</p>

<p>Very much like the vertex shader, the fragment shader also only has one must-
do job: it must set or discard the <code>gl_FragColor</code> variable, another 4D float
vector, which the final colour of our fragment. But what is a fragment? Think
of three vertices which make a triangle. Each pixel within that triangle needs
to be drawn out. A fragment is the data provided by those three vertices for
the purpose of drawing each pixel in that triangle. Because of this the
fragments receive interpolated values from their constituent vertices. If one
vertex is coloured red, and its neighbour is blue we would see the colour
values interpolate from red, through purple, to blue.</p>

<h2 id="shader-variables">Shader Variables</h2>

<p>When talking about variables there are three declarations you can make:
<strong>Uniforms</strong>, <strong>Attributes</strong> and <strong>Varyings</strong>. When I first heard of those
three I was very confused since they don’t match anything else I’d ever worked
with. But here’s how you can think of them:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Uniforms</strong> are sent to <strong>both</strong> vertex shaders and fragment shaders and contain values that stay the same across the entire frame being rendered. A good example of this might be a light’s position.</li>
  <li><strong>Attributes</strong> are values that are applied to individual vertices. Attributes are <strong>only</strong> available to the vertex shader. This could be something like each vertex having a distinct colour. Attributes have a one-to-one relationship with vertices.</li>
  <li><strong>Varying</strong>s are variables declared in the vertex shader that we want to share with the fragment shader. To do this we make sure we declare a varying variable of the same type and name in both the vertex shader and the fragment shader. A classic use of this would be a vertex’s normal since this can be used in the lighting calculations.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the second part of this article we’ll use all three types so you can get a
feel for how they are applied for real.</p>

<p>Now we’ve talked about vertex shaders and fragment shaders and the types of
variables they deal with, it’s now worth looking at the simplest shaders we
can create.</p>

<h2 id="bonjourno-world">Bonjourno World</h2>

<p>Here, then, is the Hello World of vertex shaders:</p>

</div></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-glsl" data-lang="glsl"><span class="cm">/**</span>
<span class="cm"> * Multiply each vertex by the</span>
<span class="cm"> * model-view matrix and the</span>
<span class="cm"> * projection matrix (both provided</span>
<span class="cm"> * by Three.js) to get a final</span>
<span class="cm"> * vertex position</span>
<span class="cm"> */</span>
<span class="k">void</span> <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">gl_Position</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">projectionMatrix</span> <span class="o">*</span>
                <span class="n">modelViewMatrix</span> <span class="o">*</span>
                <span class="k">vec4</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">position</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mf">1.0</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<div class="container"><div class="left column">
<p>and here’s the same for the fragment shader:
</div></div></p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-glsl" data-lang="glsl"><span class="cm">/**</span>
<span class="cm"> * Set the colour to a lovely pink.</span>
<span class="cm"> * Note that the color is a 4D Float</span>
<span class="cm"> * Vector, R,G,B and A and each part</span>
<span class="cm"> * runs from 0.0 to 1.0</span>
<span class="cm"> */</span>
<span class="k">void</span> <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">gl_FragColor</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">vec4</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">1.0</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="c1">// R</span>
                      <span class="mf">0.0</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="c1">// G</span>
                      <span class="mf">1.0</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="c1">// B</span>
                      <span class="mf">1.0</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// A</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<div class="container"><div class="left column">
<p>That’s really all there is to it. If you were to use that you would see an
‘unlit’ pink shape on your screen. Not too complicated though, right?</p>

<p>In the vertex shader we are sent a couple of uniforms by Three.js. These two
uniforms are 4D matrices, called the Model-View Matrix and the Projection
Matrix. You don’t desperately need to know exactly how these work, although
it’s always best to understand how things do what they do if you can. The
short version is that they are how the 3D position of the vertex is actually
projected to the final 2D position on the screen.</p>

<p>I’ve actually left them out of the snippet above because Three.js adds them to
the top of your shader code itself so you don’t need to worry about doing it.
Truth be told it actually adds a lot more than that, such as light data,
vertex colours and vertex normals. If you were doing this without Three.js you
would have to create and set all those uniforms and attributes yourself. True
story.</p>

<h2 id="using-a-meshshadermaterial">Using a MeshShaderMaterial</h2>

<p>OK, so we have a shader set up, but how do we use it with Three.js? It turns
out that it’s terribly easy. It’s rather like this:
</div></div></p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="cm">/**</span>
<span class="cm"> * Assume we have jQuery to hand</span>
<span class="cm"> * and pull out from the DOM the</span>
<span class="cm"> * two snippets of text for</span>
<span class="cm"> * each of our shaders</span>
<span class="cm"> */</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">vShader</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;vertexshader&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">fShader</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;fragmentshader&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">shaderMaterial</span> <span class="o">=</span>
  <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">THREE</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ShaderMaterial</span><span class="p">({</span>
    <span class="nx">vertexShader</span><span class="o">:</span>   <span class="nx">vShader</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">text</span><span class="p">(),</span>
    <span class="nx">fragmentShader</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">fShader</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">text</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="p">});</span></code></pre></div>

<div class="container"><div class="left column">
<p class="livedemo"><a href="/static/tutorials/an-introduction-to-shaders-part-1/demo/">See it running</a></p>

<p>From there Three.js will compile and run your shaders attached to the mesh to
which you give that material. It doesn’t get much easier than that really.
Well it probably does, but we’re talking about 3D running in your browser so I
figure you expect a certain amount of complexity.</p>

<p>We can actually add two more properties to our MeshShaderMaterial: uniforms
and attributes. They can both take vectors, integers or floats but as I
mentioned before uniforms are the same for the whole frame, i.e. for all
vertices, so they tend to be single values. Attributes, however, are per-
vertex variables, so they are expected to be an array. There should be a one-
to-one relationship between the number of values in the attributes array and
the number of vertices in the mesh.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I’ll stop there for now as we’ve actually covered a rather large amount, and
yet in many ways we’ve only just scratched the surface. In <a href="../an-introduction-to-shaders-part-2/">the next guide
</a> I’m going provide a more advanced
shader to which I will be passing through some attributes and uniforms as well
as doing a bit of fake lighting.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="/static/tutorials/an-introduction-to-shaders-part-1/sample.zip">wrapped up the source code</a> in this lab article so you have
it as a reference. If you’ve enjoyed this let me know via <a href="http://twitter.com/aerotwist">Twitter</a> - it makes for a happy Paul.
