<p>I like my job, actually I love it, and when someone asks me what I do, I love being able to tell them I work at Google. I like Google’s missions and products, I love what I get to do there, and, being brutally honest, it also shows that I’m good at what I do, since I actually got hired. If someone asks me what the worst part of working at Google is I just tend to say “frankly I’d be an idiot to complain about my job,” and that’s true, I really would.</p>

<h2 id="and-then-theres-twitter">… and then there’s Twitter</h2>

<p>My wife often remarks that “I’m on my phone again,” which is true. Either for work or Twitter or something else that “can’t wait”. Thing is, it’s not one-sided: goodness knows how boring it can be to read the same small person book to my kids. (They don’t seem to have the same internal limit as me for hearing each illogical, poorly-written story about Postman Pat, the Octonauts, or whatever else they’re into this week.) In many ways I will turn to the ever-interesting digital content out there just to offset the mind-numbing boredom of kids’ entertainment.</p>

<h2 id="lets-just-think-this-through"> Let’s just think this through</h2>

<p>But what if I lost my job? Or my Twitter followers realised that I am actually full of nonsense (they’re overdue to do that, really)? In many ways I feel like I am bound up by my work and online persona, and that’s what it is: a persona. It’s not me, it’s a representation of me. Real me plays the guitar (poorly), plays the bass guitar (also of variable quality) and the saxophone, does passable impressions of all the UK regional accents, has a very silly sense of humour, likes to write British English more than American English (though will happily switch to avoid confusing colleagues). Last month I apparently ran 86km (just over 53 miles, if you prefer it). There are a million things that make up being me, and very little of them get through to my online persona.</p>

<p>Do I like this version of me, this persona? Yes, in some ways I do. I get to control that persona in a way I can’t control other aspects of my life. I don’t get to choose when my children wake up in a morning, nor their deep-seated desire to have me wake up instantly and read stories (ohai terrible books… again.) I do, on the other hand, get to decide what my mood looks like to the world at large. My kids don’t seem to give a stuff about anything but being with me and their mummy, that’s the truth. There’s something really quite important about that. Soon enough they will think there’s nothing worse than having been lumbered with <em>us</em> as their parents, though I hope eventually they’ll come to realise we’re not entirely bad!</p>

<p>The digital me seems to get way more of its fair share of time compared to my family, my well-being, the stuff that actually makes up me.</p>

<h2 id="changing-it-around">Changing it around</h2>

<p>For the next month I’m going to ask my wife to hide my phones (work and personal, see?) each weekend. I will have no idea what’s being said on Twitter, Google Plus, anything. I won’t be able to take a photo or video of anything. Of course I can fire up a computer, but I won’t. Generally I’m too lazy to do that, and I guess we’ll consider that my escape hatch.</p>

<p>But more than anything I need to restore the balance in my life, to give real me and real me’s family more attention, and that’s what’s going to happen.</p>
