        <title>The Cost of Frameworks</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[I recently delivered a talk at FFConf in Brighton, called "You should use &lt;insert library / framework here&gt;, it's the bestestest!".

          <![CDATA[I'm a big fan of performance testing, but for many it's hard to get at extended data about what's going on during important parts of their website or web app's lifecycle. I've built Big Rig to try and make a dent in that problem.]]>

        <title>Spelunking in Decoratorland</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[There's a rumour of a suggestion of a thought of a concept about these things called decorators. All being well they'll land in ES7 or ES8, depending on how things pan out. I kind of do hope they pan out, because I think they're rather useful.]]>

        <title>React + Performance = ?</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[React is very popular at the moment, and I can see why: its developer ergonomics are very attractive. JSX and vDOM are really nice to work with, and it certainly enables composability. But, being the performance-minded person that I am, I wanted to test the claims that it's default-fast.]]>

          <![CDATA[Given we have the Web Audio API and getUserMedia, I wondered if I could make a passable guitar tuner. Looks like I can, and in the process I learned way more stuff about audio than I care to mention. Cool stuff, though! I thought I'd do a breakdown of what went into building it.]]>
