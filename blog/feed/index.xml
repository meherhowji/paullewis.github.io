        <title>CSS Triggers</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[I figure we needed a definitive reference for what work is triggered by changing various CSS properties.

          <![CDATA[Have you ever used the translateZ hack to create a new compositor layer? Most developers have. Now there is an incoming property that's going to change how we tell the browser what we're trying to achieve. And that, in my opinion, is almost invariably a good thing.]]>
