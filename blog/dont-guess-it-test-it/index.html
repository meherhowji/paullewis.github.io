  Giant ascii art embedded in every page of your site is how you
  show other people that YOU CARE. Mainly I care about developers,
  which is what I presume you are if you're all about viewing
  the source. Clearly you're my kind of person.

  This is v3, it's run through Jekyll, it's been fun to build,
  there's always more to do, and you may notice that aside from
  Google Analytics there is no JavaScript. None.

  That's one way of many you keep your pages fast. I care about
  keeping this site fast because your time is precious and I need
  to get out of your way.

see me using DevTools to diagnose issues, which is very handy. I also cover
other bits and pieces in more detail.</p>

<h2 id="the-tldr-version">The TL;DR version</h2>

<p>Tools not rules. Really, just that. As <a href="http://twitter.com/jaffathecake">Jake
Archibald</a> said to me when I was preparing
the talk, many people want a quick fix to the problem of performance, just
like a weight loss pill, but in reality what they really need is <em>exercise</em>.
I’m advocating for the practice of using profilers, understanding what our
code is doing, and fixing our actual bottlenecks.</p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="//aerotwist.com/presentations/dont-
guess-it-test-it/#1">check out the slides</a>, but you will need to watch the video to see the “how to”
bits.</p>

<h2 id="performance-advice-considered-addictive">Performance Advice Considered Addictive</h2>

<p>So often people want to know if A is faster than B, or if C is “considered
harmful”. This is problematic for a couple reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Things change as browser internals change</li>
  <li>It will depend on your specific application: optimizing a game is very different to optimizing a web app that will be open in a tab for days.</li>
</ol>

<p>In any case I’m acknowledging the fact that we all want our apps to go faster,
and we rarely feel that we have the time to devote to profiling our code.
Unfortunately as developers we’re responsible for the code we ship, and we
have a duty to make it perform well. Code that works quickly (and correctly)
is <em>exactly</em> what we’re paid to deliver.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-love-the-devtools-frame-mode">Learn to love the DevTools frame mode</h2>

<p>Before we go much further, you should make sure you know what frame mode is in
the DevTools timeline. Essentially it shows you the work that Chrome is having
to do to run your app, and it handily includes a line marking 60fps. If your
bars are going above that line, you’re busting your budget and your app is
going to feel clunky. There’s a <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2012/11/build-smoother-web-apps-with-
chrome.html">Chromium Blog post about frame
mode</a>, so check that out if you’ve never heard of it before.</p>

<h2 id="the-performance-cerberus">The Performance Cerberus</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerberus">Cerberus</a> is a three-headed dog (a
mythological one, don’t freak out) and is as mean as you can imagine. That
fits our view of things here, since performance is a badass three-headed topic
that will bite you in the rear end if you make it mad. Mind you, he guards the
Underworld… Hmm… OK, let’s park that overstretched analogy right there, and
take a look at the three bits of performance we’re interested in: <strong>Network</strong>,
<strong>Compute</strong> and <strong>Render</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="network">Network</h2>

<p>60% of web traffic is images. That’s a huge amount of data. Your users have to
<em>pay to download it</em> if they’re on a metered data plan each month (most users
in the UK, as one example, are capped somewhere around the 1GB mark on mobile)
and chances are your hosting is metered as well: you pay for users downloading
files. As such you may want to look at the format in which you’re serving your
images. WebP currently offers huge file size savings when compared to the
equivalent quality (that quality bit’s important; you can always beat a codec
by lowering your quality in another!) JPEG or PNG. If you run your own servers
you could do much worse than looking at
<a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/mod">mod_pagespeed</a>, since that
magically optimizes your site on the fly, minimizing and re-encoding assets.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That fits our view of things here, since performance is a badass three-headed topic that will bite you in the rear end if you make it mad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Secondly you might want to take a look at the number of requests your site
makes. Unless your user is on SPDY or HTTP 2.0 then every file will need to be
requested separately, and every request will potentially have a large latency
on it. It’s worth remembering that bandwidth isn’t latency, so even if you’re
on a 3G connection (or better), that doesn’t necessarily correlate to lower
latency!</p>

<p>Finally, bear in mind that a request will keep the radio active on a mobile
device. The radio is the second most draining item after the screen, so really
we want to get it shut off as soon as we can. Otherwise your users will
complain that your site destroys battery life, and that’s not a good complaint
to have leveraged at you.</p>

<p><a href="http://igvita.com/">Ilya Grigorik</a> is on my team and provides so much good
information on this topic. You should totally go and read his articles and
slide decks.</p>

<h2 id="compute">Compute</h2>

<p>All our JavaScript runs inside an engine. In Chrome’s case the engine is V8,
and like other engines in top-tier browsers, it’s incredibly fast. It’s fast
because it watches your code and swaps it out at the function level with an
optimized equivalent code.</p>

<p>The first thing you want to avoid is your code being deoptimized, which is
where the <em>old, slower code</em> has to be resubstituted back in for the faster
version. There are many reasons why this can happen, and they change
(reminder: nothing stays the same) so the best thing you can do is to run a
tool called <code>d8</code>, which is a standalone version of V8 which will tell you if
your JavaScript got deoptimized. For more info check out <a href="http://floitsch.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/optimizing-
for-v8-inlining.html">Optimizing for V8 -
Inlining, deoptimizations</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, since you don’t retain and release memory yourself in JavaScript,
you’re at the mercy of the garbage collector. Why? Because memory usage from
all your declared objects would grow and grow. You never manually release
their memory, so the garbage collector has to come and clean them up when
they’re not needed anymore. Unfortunately garbage collection (GC) is not free
and blocks JavaScript execution while it tidies up. Chrome DevTools handily
points out to you when GC has occurred, so you should take time to see if
you’re generating a lot of garbage and see if your code is being paused for
its collection.</p>

<h2 id="render">Render</h2>

<p>Your DOM becoming pixels on the screen can be one of the most costly parts of
your app’s lifecycle. Crucially when <em>additional</em> painting needs to occur as
part of interaction with your app can resulting the app slowing. UI
interactions, scrolling, content injections all cause the page to visibly
change, and those changes need to be painted to the screen.</p>

<p>Painting also encapsulates the decoding (you send a PNG, we need a bitmap in
memory) and resizing (you send it at 1000px wide for a 300px wide element) of
your app’s images. Interestingly there’s a cache available for these decoded
images, but if you have a lot of images being decoded soon enough some images
will need to be dropped from the cache.</p>

<p>A quick study of the DevTools timeline will show you what’s going on, so again
it’s worth checking those out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your DOM becoming pixels on the screen can be one of the most costly parts of your app’s lifecycle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The important thing with painting is first to reduce the size of the paint
area. You can quickly assess that with a feature called Show Paint Rectangles
in Chrome’s DevTools, which puts a red box around the areas that needed to be
repainted. To switch it on head over to DevTools and hit the cog in the bottom
right hand corner. From there choose “Show Paint Rectangles”.</p>

<p>If you see a full screen flash of red when you scrolled (as one example) the
chances are you’re painting more than you thought you were going to. In any
case reduce your paint area to the absolute minimum, and verify you’re only
repainting the areas you meant to.</p>

<p>Secondly, assuming you’re painting the minimum, check to see if you have
expensive styles. You can do that with the Continuous Paint Mode in Canary’s
DevTools, <a href="//aerotwist.com/blog/on-
translate3d-and-layer-creation-hacks/">which I’ve talked about before</a>. Essentially it forces Chrome to
repaint your page on every frame, and that means you can start toggling
elements and styles off to see if and where you have a paint bottleneck.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Performance is a big deal, it’s what takes your app from mediocre to great,
and we need to take it seriously. A great app means your users will be
happier, which in turn leads to more sales and more good will towards you and
your app.</p>

<p>Finally, always trust the profilers, and don’t commit specific rules to your
head. They change.</p>

<p>Don’t guess it… you get the idea.</p>
